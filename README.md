# Doki Daoist Literature Club
A Chinese philosopher dating sim.

## How do I play?
1. Go to the [Beta Test Version](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DIM5ZfGbooWikFN5F0CAlzJQFKe4l-0N?usp=sharing) GDrive folder.
2. Select the appropriate (Mac or Windows/Linux) distribution zip and download it.
3. Unzip and double click the Doki Daoist Literature Club app inside the folder to play.

*Note:* The beta version is incomplete and does not contain all game content. It's mostly a proof of concept and should be treated as such.

## Why?
This project was created for the midterm annotation assignment for Maura Dykstra's H 138 (The Way) class at Caltech.

## What should I expect?
Sexy philosophers, a fun story with textual excerpts from Guanzi's *Inward Training* and Laozi's *Dao De Jing*, and some memey surprises.
Do note that this game was created over the course of a week, so don't expect particularly high quality code or gameplay. It's meant to be
a fun little game that can be finished in an hour or less, designed to illuminate the referenced texts more than anything.

## Content Warnings
**Varyn's totally not official rating:** T 
- some elements of surprise too mild to be considered jumpscares
- mentions of death
- mild suggestive content (you should know what sex is before playing this game, but no actual nsfw content is present)
- spoilers for *Inward Training* and the *Dao De Jing*
- some discussion of politics, though no actual current events are brought up
